# Skillz

Starting to play with [claude skills](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview).

VS Code now has experimental [support for claude skills](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_107#_reuse-your-claude-skills-experimental).

To use these:

```sh
mkdir ~/.claude
git clone https://github.com/scaryrawr/skillz ~/.claude/skills
```

Won't work if you already have skills.
